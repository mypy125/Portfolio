        I develop a reliable and easily expandable server part.
        That's what I'm especially good at.       
        Java with Spring Boot - I write fast and stable server applications.       
        Node.js with Express - I create light and flexible web services.       
        JWT-authentication - I implement safe login and data protection.       
        Docker - I pack applications into containers for convenient launch and scaling.        
        CI/CD - I set up automatic assembly and deployment of projects.

        I develop APIs that are easily scalable and well documented.
        Technologies I work with.
        Swagger, Postman, OpenAPI — for API documentation and testing.
        OAuth2, JWT — for safe authorization and user authentication.
        Limiting the number of requests (Rate Limiting) — so that the API is not overloaded.
        Testing with JUnit and Postman — to make sure that the API works correctly.

        I design effective database structures and optimize requests for high performance.
        Technologies I work with.
        MySQL, PostgreSQL — relational databases for storing structured information.
        MongoDB is a document-oriented database, well suited for flexible data structures.
        Redis — a caching system that helps speed up access to frequently used data.
        ORM-tools Hibernate — simplify the work with the database through the object-oriented approach.
